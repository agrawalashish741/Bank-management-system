Here I have made the mini bank management system where i have tried to perform all the basic operations such as account opening,closing of account,mantaining balance,creating and modifying pin etc. and tried to integrate it with the database such as SQL.
Each account no should contain date of birth,adress,mobile no,gender,eamil and password.On creating new account system generate the new account no for the customer.
To login one must has to enter email and password without which it will throw an error.
Customer can view their details and their tansaction history.
